My name is Summer, pronounced just like season, and my pronouns are she/her. This is me! (And my family, of course.)

This photo is delightful because it contains my two favorite things: my family and a dinosaur! It’s also a little unusual because I’m more of a public lands adventurer than a big-attractions kind of person, so our family vacations up to this point had been hiking, camping, backpacking, exploring national parks, etc. But Torin is graduating and moving into their adult life this year (working as an EMT while pursuing paramedic school), so we decided to go big and make the trip south to Universal Studios. 

I’m a graduate student in Biology, with an emphasis in Natural Resources. My undergrad was in Social Science and I have another masters degree in Public Administration with an emphasis on Nonprofit Leadership. Those degrees served me well in leadership positions in public healthcare. (While attending GVSU, I am continuing to serve as the Executive Director of my nonprofit (Comprehensive Therapy Center)(https://therapycenter.org) - the GR Chamber’s nonprofit of the year!  But almost two decades (and a pandemic) later, I’m opting  for a mid-career shift that takes me outside more. 

I don’t know exactly what that career looks like yet, but I’m seeking certifications in GIS and restoration ecology along the way, and I’m sure I’ll continue to fold my passion for accessibility and inclusion into any future work. I plan to get a Ph.D. at some point, but no solid plans yet.

I’m taking this class because it kills two birds with one stone:

1. A Ph.D. program director recommended I take a course on statistics with R
2. It’s an  elective for the GID certificate 

I don’t have anyone to point you towards as the person who has the career of my dreams. I’m honestly burnt out on “career” and am just looking for the kind of job where I can find a better balance of joy vrs stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
